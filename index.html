<p class=MsoNormal>ERROR: This program uses frames, but your browser doesn't support  them. <br>You will have to change your browser settings to view this page.<br> Or use a different browser. If this dosen't work you will need to go through the cd looking for the year that you want to go onto then click on them with out the frames or just look for the file with which should be in the location= cdromdrive/gj/work/.... then look for the year that you want. Or if this is to annoying please use the no fames page which is better for people who do not like frames.</p>
